## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- DigitalOcean account (optional, for agent deployment)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Add your Replicate API token to environment variables:
   - In v0: Go to sidebar → Vars → Add `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN`
   - Locally: Create `.env.local` and add `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_token`

4. Run the development server:
   \`\`\`bash
   npm run dev
   \`\`\`

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## DigitalOcean Agent Deployment (Optional)

To deploy the AI agent on DigitalOcean's Gradient AI Platform:

1. Install Python dependencies:
   \`\`\`bash
   pip install pydo
   \`\`\`

2. Run the deployment script:
   \`\`\`bash
   python scripts/deploy_do_agent.py \
     --token YOUR_DO_TOKEN \
     --project-id YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
     --region nyc1
   \`\`\`

3. Note the Agent UUID and add it to your environment variables

## How It Works

1. **Upload**: User uploads a photo of their dog
2. **Analysis**: AI vision model analyzes the dog's appearance, body language, and characteristics

   - Psychological Evaluation (anxiety, confidence, attachment style)
   - Diagnosis (humorous but insightful conditions)
   - Treatment Recommendations (training tips, lifestyle changes)
   - Prognosis (outlook for behavioral health)
4. **Results**: User receives a professional-looking therapy report
